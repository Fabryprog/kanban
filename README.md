# Kanban

A simple kanban board for your daily tasks based on HTML5/JS with local storage.

## This project IS about:
* A simple kanban board to help a single person.
* A fixed 3 column kanban (To Do, Work In progress, Done)
* Simple task model: title, description and status.
* Tasks stored on your browser cache.
* In case you lose your board, it won't ruin your life.

## This project IS NOT about:
* A flexible shared kanban board to help a team.
* Custom kanban board (columns, colors, etc.).
* Detailed tasks data, statistics and analysis.

## Installing instructions:

Just clone the project contents and run the index.html file with your favourite browser.

````
git clone http://github.com/rafaelodon/kanban
```

Since the kanban board data is cached consideering the accessed URL, I strongly suggest you to clone it inside your Apache or Nginx public www folder (e.g. /var/www/kanban) and access it via URL (e.g. http://localhost/kanban).
